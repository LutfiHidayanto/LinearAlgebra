# Matrix Calculator for Linear Algebra

A Python program that performs various matrix calculations, including solving linear equation systems, singular value decomposition, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, matrix inverses, checking if a matrix is diagonal, polynomial characteristics, and diagonalizing matrices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy library
- sympy library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the program files.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy sympy
   ```
   or
   ```
   pip3 install numpy sympy
   ```

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the program files are located.
3. Run the program by executing the following command:
   ```
   python matrix_calculator.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose the desired operation and provide the necessary inputs.
